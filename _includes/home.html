      My academic journey began with a degree in Software Engineering in 2006. 
      After several years working as a programmer, I pursued my passion for linguistic studies at Allameh Tabataba'i University in Tehran, Iran, in 2015. 
      The integration of my expertise in both fields led to join an interdisciplinary work in computational linguistics at Ruhr University Bochum in 2017, where I focused on Biscuit conditionals.
      I further advanced my studies with a Ph.D. at the University of Konstanz, focusing on semantics-pragmatics. 
      I graduated in 2024 with a dissertation entitled "AA". 
      During my Ph.D., I was awarded a scholarship to visit UMass (Amherst) for the fall semester of 2023, an enriching experience that broadened my academic horizons.
      My next chapter begins as a postdoctoral researcher at Bielefeld University, where I will collaborate on the <a href = "https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/linguistik-literaturwissenschaft/forschung/projekte/crc1646/"> CRC project </a>, continuing to explore the dynamic intersection of linguistics and technology.
