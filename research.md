<p>
My research interests center on semantics and pragmatics, with a focus on theoretical aspects supported by empirical data. 
Thus, many of my studies incorporate experimental data. I have primarily investigated bias in polar questions and response particles, providing experimental data from Farsi. While cross-linguistic studies are invaluable for developing linguistic theories, I believe Farsi has significant potential to contribute unique insights. 

I enjoy working with various languages and exploring new data. My research includes conducting experiments in both production (audio data) and perception (acceptability judgments) in Farsi and English. Additionally, I have a strong interest in developing data visualizations and performing statistical data analysis.
